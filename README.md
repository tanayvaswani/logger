# Designing Logging Framework in Python

A logging framework is a tool that provides a way to record, format, filter and route log messages generated by an application during execution.

Frameworks like **Log4j**, **SLF4J**, and **java.util.logging** power millions of production services.

## Demo

```python
logger.info("info message")
logger.debug("debug message")
logger.warn("warning message")
```

## Basic Requirements

1. Different Log Levels.
2. Logs with a timestamp, log level, and message content.
3. Support multiple output destinations.
4. Configuration mechanism to set the log level and output destination.
5. Thread safe to handle concurrent logging from multiple threads.
6. Extensible to accommodate new log levels and output destinations in the future.
